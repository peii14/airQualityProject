# airQualityProject
AAF Software Engineering
## Software Description
This system is an application software with the main function to determine in a given location and timespan if the air quality is good or bad. The system calculates the four main attribute (O3, SO2, NO2, PM10) values that characterize the air quality in these areas. The data that is retrieved by the system ranges from January to December of 2017. This application allows the user to view the air quality result of a given sensor and timespan with all the average attribute values that characterize the air quality. It also gives users an approximation of sensors with similar attribute values.<br/>
